## ColangTranslator HOW TO USE
To add your own colang open example_translations.txt
To add your own words use this format "input": "output",
Example if you type "hi" into the translator, it will translate it to "output"

## You can have more than one language, too!
Just copy and paste the example_translations.txt and replace example with your language 
(do not delete _translations or the code will not load your new language)
Remember to not add any underscores to your language's name, though (except the existing one before translations)
